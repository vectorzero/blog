For example, <code>21</code> is the GCD of <code>252</code> and <code>105</code> (as <code>252 = 21 \xD7 12</code> and <code>105 = 21 \xD7 5</code>), and the same number <code>21</code> is also the GCD of <code>105</code> and <code>252 \u2212 105 = 147</code>. Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers, repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal. When that occurs, they are the GCD of the original two numbers.</p><p>By reversing the steps, the GCD can be expressed as a sum of the two original numbers each multiplied by a positive or negative integer, e.g., <code>21 = 5 \xD7 105 + (\u22122) \xD7 252</code>. The fact that the GCD can always be expressed in this way is known as B\xE9zout&#39;s identity.</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Euclid&#39;s_algorithm_Book_VII_Proposition_2_3.png" alt="GCD"></p><p>Euclid&#39;s method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two starting lengths <code>BA</code> and <code>DC</code>, both defined to be multiples of a common &quot;unit&quot; length. The length <code>DC</code> being shorter, it is used to &quot;measure&quot; <code>BA</code>, but only once because remainder <code>EA</code> is less than <code>DC</code>. EA now measures (twice) the shorter length <code>DC</code>, with remainder <code>FC</code> shorter than <code>EA</code>. Then <code>FC</code> measures (three times) length <code>EA</code>. Because there is no remainder, the process ends with <code>FC</code> being the <code>GCD</code>.
