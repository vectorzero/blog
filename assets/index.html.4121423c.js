He went on to provide a detailed step-by-step description of an iterative algorithm to calculate <code>\u03C0</code> to any required accuracy based on bisecting polygons; he calculated <code>\u03C0</code> to between <code>3.141024</code> and <code>3.142708</code> with a 96-gon; he suggested that <code>3.14</code> was a good enough approximation, and expressed <code>\u03C0</code> as <code>157/50</code>; he admitted that this number was a bit small. Later he invented an ingenious quick method to improve on it, and obtained <code>\u03C0 \u2248 3.1416</code> with only a 96-gon, with an accuracy comparable to that from a 1536-gon. His most important contribution in this area was his simple iterative <code>\u03C0</code> algorithm.</p><h2 id="area-of-a-circle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#area-of-a-circle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Area of a circle</h2><p>Liu Hui argued:</p><blockquote><p>Multiply one side of a hexagon by the radius (of its circumcircle), then multiply this by three, to yield the area of a dodecagon; if we cut a hexagon into a dodecagon, multiply its side by its radius, then again multiply by six, we get the area of a 24-gon; the finer we cut, the smaller the loss with respect to the area of circle, thus with further cut after cut, the area of the resulting polygon will coincide and become one with the circle; there will be no loss</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Cutcircle2.svg" alt="Liu Hui"></p><p>Liu Hui&#39;s method of calculating the area of a circle.</p><p>Further, Liu Hui proved that the area of a circle is half of its circumference multiplied by its radius.

Starting with a hexagon, Liu Hui could determine the side length of a dodecagon using this formula. Then continue repetitively to determine the side length of a 24-gon given the side length of a dodecagon. He could do this recursively as many times as necessary. Knowing how to determine the area of these polygons, Liu Hui could then approximate <code>\u03C0</code>.</p><h2 id="references" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#references" aria-hidden="true">#</a> References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Hui%27s_%CF%80_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>',27),d=[r];function c(h,s){return i(),t("div",null,d)}var l=e(o,[["render",c],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
